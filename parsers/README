The lexical and syntactic parsers that govern the functionality behind the .access files.

checkSyntax.y + accessTokens.l combine to define a simple syntax checker for any .access file.

checkAccess.y + accessTokens2.l combine to define behavior governing the contents of the .access file.


Functionality notes:

The Makefile here is a demonstration of how the end product will look; it compiles object files out of the two parsers and puts them into an arbitrary third file, where main() is located.

In the program with main(), the pointers extern FILE *csyin, *cacin need to be opened on the appropriate .access file (after ensuring ownership...)

Then, csyparse() and cacparse() may be called (in this order).

Moving forward:

The user-checking and permission granting parts of checkAccess.y need to be implemented. That is, we need to check for a couple things:

1) That the owner (ruid) of THIS (get / put) is the same as the owner of the file AND file.access

2) That the user (euid) is granted appropriate access in the .access file

In cases where these are not true, silently exit.


HOW TO USE: 

csyparse(), the syntax checker, may be used as is once setting CSYIN (example in testProg.c)

cacparse(), which needs some functionality still, will return a 1 if the user was either not found in the .access file OR if they do not have the proper permissions. Else, return 0.
